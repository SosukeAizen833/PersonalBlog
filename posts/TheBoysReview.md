**The Boys**' episode 6 starts a video of The Deep and a few other celebrities (icluding Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis) sing John Lennon's Imagine. This is very much an attempt to calm the nerves of the general populace in the aftermath of Soldier Boy blowing up a midtown restaurant with his Deus Ex Machina which, as we learn in the earlier episodes, can burn Compound V from the bodies of the supes who are exposed to it. The video is a very obvious attempt to parody the real world video in which numerous personalities led by Gal Gadot came together to sing the very same song in a distasteful attempt to soothe the public.
